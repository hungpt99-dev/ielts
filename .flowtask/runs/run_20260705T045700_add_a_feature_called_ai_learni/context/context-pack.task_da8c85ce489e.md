# FlowTask Context Pack

## Original User Prompt

Add a feature called **AI Learning Progress Review** to IELTS Journey.

This feature allows users to review their learning progress after a period of time, such as after 7 days, 30 days, or a custom date range.

AI Tutor should act like a real IELTS tutor and analyze what the user has studied during that period. It should review the user’s completed lessons, practiced skills, saved vocabulary, mistakes, study consistency, weak areas, and improvement.

The AI should then generate a clear progress report that includes:

* Overall learning summary
* What the user improved
* What the user still struggles with
* Repeated mistakes
* Vocabulary review status
* Skill-by-skill progress for Listening, Reading, Writing, and Speaking
* Whether the user is following the study plan well
* Recommended focus for the next period
* Encouraging tutor-style feedback

The goal is to help users understand their real progress, know what to improve next, and feel like they have a personal IELTS tutor reviewing their study journey regularly.


## Current Task

### Implement AIProgressReviewController to Call AI Tutor and Parse Report

Create AIProgressReviewController in packages/ai-tutor/src/controllers/AIProgressReviewController.ts that uses AIProgressReviewService to get user data, calls AI Tutor with the prompt builder, and parses the AI response into structured report data. Handle errors and fallback gracefully. Export controller for use by UI components.

# Development Mode Rules

This project is in **development** mode.

## Behavior
- Inspect the project before editing.
- Make focused, small code changes.
- Follow existing code style and project conventions.
- Do not make unrelated changes.
- Validate with lint/typecheck/test when configured.
- Do not claim success without evidence.
- Risky actions (install dependency, delete files, git push) require approval.

## Validation
- Code validation is enabled by default.
- Run configured quality commands when available.
- Validation runs serially and safely by default.
- Avoid spawning many test workers at once.
- Use narrow, focused test commands when possible.
- Do not run expensive full test suites repeatedly.
- Git diff may be required for changes.
