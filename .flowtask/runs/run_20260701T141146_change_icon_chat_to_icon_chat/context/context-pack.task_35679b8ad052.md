# Development Mode Rules

This project is in **development** mode.

## Behavior
- Inspect the project before editing.
- Make focused, small code changes.
- Follow existing code style and project conventions.
- Do not make unrelated changes.
- Validate with lint/typecheck/test when configured.
- Do not claim success without evidence.
- Risky actions (install dependency, delete files, git push) require approval.

## Validation
- Code validation is enabled by default.
- Run configured quality commands when available.
- Validation runs serially and safely by default.
- Avoid spawning many test workers at once.
- Use narrow, focused test commands when possible.
- Do not run expensive full test suites repeatedly.
- Git diff may be required for changes.
